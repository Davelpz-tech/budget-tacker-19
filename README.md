# Budget Racker - Module 19

## About This Project

#### The budget tracker application is a Prgressive web application that allows you to add and remove expenses to track your budget and view its shift through a visible medium which in this case is a graph. The application can be used online or offline by using service workers.

## How it works:

#### The program initializes with a fron end UI on load that gives you options to add and remove expenses as well as assign these expenses names. Adding a dollar amount to your expense or removing will automatically affect the graph that is shown below. You'll want to add multiple items in order to truly see the changes in your budget.

## Challenges:

#### I ran into issues getting my Github to recieve my pushes. Was unable to upload the working code at time of assignment submission. Will be working with a TA or Instructional staff in order to resolve this problem.
